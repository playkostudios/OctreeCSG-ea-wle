# NOTICE

This project is abandoned! We've since switched over to [Manifold](https://github.com/elalish/manifold/).

We made an integration library for Manifold and Wonderland Engine too. You can find it [here](https://github.com/playkostudios/gypsum).

Old README:

# OctreeCSG-ea-wle

[Wonderland Engine](https://wonderlandengine.com/) integration for the
[OctreeCSG-ea library](https://github.com/playkostudios/OctreeCSG-ea).
**This is very work-in-progress**.

Note that this project is not affiliated with the OctreeCSG project.

Contains utilities for converting `WL.Mesh` objects into Octrees and vice-versa.
